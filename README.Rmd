# ðŸ“¦ makepkg

The `makepkg` R package is a utility designed to bridge the world of R development with Arch Linux package management. By leveraging the DESCRIPTION file present in R packages, `makepkg` automates the creation of Arch Linux package descriptions (PKGBUILD files). 

This simplifies the process of packaging R packages for Arch Linux, making it easier for R developers to distribute their work to a wider audience.

## Features

- **Automated PKGBUILD Generation**: `makepkg` reads the DESCRIPTION file from an R package and generates a corresponding PKGBUILD file, which is essential for creating Arch Linux packages.

- **Simplified Workflow**: `makepkg` reduces the manual effort required to package R packages for Arch Linux, streamlining the distribution process.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `makepkg` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("m3nin0-labs/makepkg")
```

## Usage

To use `makepkg`, you simply need to call its main function with the path to the R package's DESCRIPTION file and the desired output path for the PKGBUILD file:

```r
makepkg::makepkg("/path/to/DESCRIPTION", "/path/to/output/file")
```

This function call will generate a PKGBUILD file at the specified output location, which can then be used with the standard Arch Linux packaging tools to create an Arch package.
